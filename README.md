## GitHub Game Off 2018

This years GitHub Game Off theme was "hybrid". Chicken Dash is a combination of two popular mobile games, Crossy Road & Traffic Rush.

## Tutorial

The objective of the game is to get as many chickens across the road as possible without any being hit.

Chickens can be stopped by tapping/clicking on them, tap/click again to continue walking. Chickens can be made to run be swiping/dragging them in the direction that they are walking.

When a chicken is hit, the game is over.
